Only shared API, cross-stream, and design-contract questions belong here. Local proof problems stay
in their workstream.

## IQ-001 — spectral-resolution and integral interface

- **Status:** OPEN / RED
- **Affected streams:** architecture, Mathlib reconnaissance, spectral bands, tagged sums, Verso
- **Question:** What is the smallest canonical public object that faithfully packages Sakai 1.11.3
  without constructing a parallel measure theory beside Mathlib?
- **Constraints:** preserve `spectralProjectionIio` half-line semantics; do not claim a general
  set-indexed projection-valued measure prematurely; keep finite sums usable as rewrite tools.
- **Evidence obtained:** `reports/MATHLIB_SPECTRAL_AUDIT.md` shows that Mathlib's vector-measure
  integral is norm/variation based, neither pinned nor current Mathlib has a general PVM, and the
  current archived Riemann--Stieltjes API is norm-topological. D002's scratch comparison proves the
  generic and spectral-specific predicates equivalent for every real integrand, not just the
  identity. Atom counterexamples rule out unrestricted mesh-only semantics for discontinuous
  weights, and the canonical-specific predicate cannot state Sakai's arbitrary competing
  resolution `e'`. The truncated-affine transaction now adds a sharp canonical theorem with an
  interior cutoff and the exact existing CFC target. An arbitrary monotone projection family also
  satisfies the corresponding finite positive-part identity under exact endpoint normalization,
  but passing to the target through `Filter.Tendsto.cfc` requires norm moment convergence, which is
  stronger than Sakai's ultraweak representation. Support recovery additionally needs lower
  bounds, an upper-support identity, and continuity from below; support is not continuous under
  norm limits. The fixed-projection transaction now kernel-checks the exact finite cutoff algebra,
  the total-moment-only positive/negative decomposition, both support inequalities, the `Iio` LUB
  recovery, and pointwise/family uniqueness under explicit inserted-cut approximation data. The
  only missing edge from Sakai's clauses is a division-independent representation/refinement
  theorem that constructs those data.
- **Decision so far:** publish the canonical theorem layer only. Publish neither experimental
  integral predicate nor a lower-family, resolution, or PVM structure. Publish the general
  fixed-projection decomposition and coherent support helpers under D004. The architecture remains
  OPEN / RED precisely at the source representation/refinement boundary.
- **Next bounded action:** design and scratch-test a directed finite-division semantics for the
  ultraweak Radon--Stieltjes representation. Prove cofinality after inserting any prescribed finite
  set of cuts and derive the translated total moment plus varying endpoint-residual nets consumed
  by the checked support-recovery theorem.

## IQ-002 — spectral helper generality

- **Status:** RESOLVED for the first wave
- **Affected streams:** spectral bands and tagged sums
- **Question:** Which interval-projection and tagged-sum facts are naturally generic for any
  monotone projection family, and which should remain specialized to `spectralProjectionIio`?
- **Default:** prove generic theorem-level facts where the assumptions stay recognizable; do not
  introduce a generic bundled spectral-family structure merely to share one proof.
- **Decision:** extract only the four-projection orthogonality fact to the nonunital Mathlib-staging
  layer. Keep spectral-band and tagged-sum declarations specialized to `spectralProjectionIio`,
  with named bridges showing that the existing lower and upper sums are endpoint-tag cases.

## IQ-003 — `TwoSidedIdeal` representation

- **Status:** HUMAN REVIEW; inherited from root `REVIEW_QUEUE.md`
- **Affected streams:** ideals, future upstreaming
- **Default:** preserve the existing native Mathlib object and its completed API. Do not implement
  the alternative representation in parallel.

## IQ-004 — orchestration versus theorem-status source

- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Decision:** coordination files may track ownership, interface stability, and architectural
  dependencies, but Verso remains the only theorem-status/dependency registry.
